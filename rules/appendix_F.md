Rule 8 formula. A player gains x times n points where x is the base amount of points and n is defined as floor(log[base2]\(m))+1 where m is the number of blocks in a player's tower. 
Example: Player 1 has 12 blocks in her tower and successfully passes a change to rules.md, they would gain 1 * floor(log[base2]\(12)+1 points or 4 total points. 

Rule 9 formula. To add a block to a player's tower, it costs points equal to the current height of the tower.
Example: Bartholomew has 12 blocks in her tower and would like to add another one. They would need to spend 12 points to do so.
