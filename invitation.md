# :tada: You are cordially invited to play Nomic :tada:

Nomic is an interesting game where each move in the game changes the rules of the game, even how you win can be modified. 

This version of the game uses Github to keep track of the rules and to facilitate voting and discussion on rule changes. The game is played in a [correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess) fashion, so you only need to check in every few days. There are also rules for going _inactive_ if you can't play for a short period or wish to take a break.

### Get Started

1. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/join)
2. Make your first ammendant by adding yourself to the player list. Go to the [Players.md](players.md) file, click the little pencil icon and add yourself to the active players table with the starting resources outlined according to the [rules](rules.md#104-ab-initio).
3. If this is your first amendment, it'll ask you to create a fork before submitting. Click yes.
4. Submit your amendment by creating a "pull request". As soon as it's merged in by a mod, you are playing!
