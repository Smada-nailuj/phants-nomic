Rule 8 formula. A player gains x times n points where x is the base amount of points and n is defined as floor(log[base2](m))+1 where m is the number of blocks in a player's tower. 
Example: Player 1 has 12 blocks in her tower and successfully passes a change to rules.md, they would gain 1 * floor(log[base2](12)+1 points or 4 total points.
